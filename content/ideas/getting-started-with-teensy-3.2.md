# Teensy 3.2
The [Teensy 3.2][06] is a microcontroller development system,
using the ARM Cortex processors,
where all programming is done via a USB port.
Its compatible with Arduino software & libraries and has
free software development tools including Teensy Loader application
(works with Mac OS X, Linux & Windows).

## ARM Cortex-M4
The ARM Cortex-M is a group of [32-bit RISC ARM][03] processor cores licensed by [ARM Holdings][02].
The cores are intended for microcontroller use, and consist of
the [ultra-low-power Cortex-M0+ to the top-of-the-range, high-performance Cortex-M7][05].
The [Cortex-M4][04] has been specifically developed for high-performance low-cost devices
for a broad range of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and embedded controller market.

## Additional Features
The [Teensy 3.2 is a step up from previous version of the Teensy family][]:

* 64K of RAM, 256K of flash memory, and 2K EEPROM
* Teensy 3.2 has a powerful 3.3 volt regulator,
with the ability to directly power ESP8266 Wifi,
WIZ820io Ethernet and other power-hungry 3.3V add-on boards.
* All digital pins are 5 volt tolerant on Teensy 3.2. However,
the analog-only pins (A10-A14), AREF, Program and Reset are 3.3V only.
* 12 Bit DAC analog output and two analog to digital converters inputs
